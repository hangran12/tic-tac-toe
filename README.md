This game implements a Tic Tac Toe game for two players. Player X and 
Player O alternate placing tokens on the board until one player wins or until 
all spaces have been taken on the board. You may use the Reset Game option to 
start the game over at any time. 

This was my first project using React, so during the development process I 
consulted the following tutorial: 
https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html 

I adapted the code from a 3x3 game into a 5x5 game in order to demonstrate 
my understanding. 

After downloading the 5x5tictactoe folder, you can run `npm start` in the 
project directory in order to open the app in development mode. 

Then, open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Enjoy!

Note: If you receive the error message that react-scripts start fails to start
while using npm, run the following commands before running npm start: 

`npm install -g npm@latest`
`rm -rf node_modules`
`npm install`
